% Users of the {thebibliography} environment or BibTeX should use the
% scicite.sty package, downloadable from *Science* at
% www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/TeX_help/ .

% The preamble here sets up a lot of new/revised commands and
% environments.  It's annoying, but please do *not* try to strip these
% out into a separate .sty file (which could lead to the loss of some
% information when we convert the file to other formats).  Instead, keep
% them in the preamble of your main LaTeX source file.

% If your reference list includes text notes as well as references,
% include the following line; otherwise, comment it out.

\renewcommand\refname{References and Notes}

% The following lines set up an environment for the last note in the
% reference list, which commonly includes acknowledgments of funding,
% help, etc.  It's intended for users of BibTeX or the {thebibliography}
% environment.  Users who are hand-coding their references at the end
% using a list environment such as {enumerate} can simply add another
% item at the end, and it will be numbered automatically.

\newcounter{lastnote}

\setcounter{lastnote}{\value{enumiv}}%
