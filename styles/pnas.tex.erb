%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% BASIC CLASS FILE
%% PNAStwo for two column articles is called by default.
%% Uncomment PNASone for single column articles. One column class
%% and style files are available upon request from pnas@nas.edu.
%% (uncomment means get rid of the '%' in front of the command)

%\documentclass{pnasone}
\documentclass{pnastwo}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Changing position of text on physical page:
%% Since not all printers position
%% the printed page in the same place on the physical page,
%% you can change the position yourself here, if you need to:

% \advance\voffset -.5in % Minus dimension will raise the printed page on the
                         %  physical page; positive dimension will lower it.

%% You may set the dimension to the size that you need.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL GRAPHICS STYLE FILE

%% Requires graphics style file (graphicx.sty), used for inserting
%% .eps files into LaTeX articles.
%% Note that inclusion of .eps files is for your reference only;
%% when submitting to PNAS please submit figures separately.

%% Type into the square brackets the name of the driver program
%% that you are using. If you don't know, try dvips, which is the
%% most common PC driver, or textures for the Mac. These are the options:

% [dvips], [xdvi], [dvipdf], [dvipdfm], [dvipdfmx], [pdftex], [dvipsone],
% [dviwindo], [emtex], [dviwin], [pctexps], [pctexwin], [pctexhp], [pctex32],
% [truetex], [tcidvi], [vtex], [oztex], [textures], [xetex]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL POSTSCRIPT FONT FILES

%% PostScript font files: You may need to edit the PNASoneF.sty
%% or PNAStwoF.sty file to make the font names match those on your system.
%% Alternatively, you can leave the font style file commands commented out
%% and typeset your article using the default Computer Modern
%% fonts (recommended). If accepted, your article will be typeset
%% at PNAS using PostScript fonts.


% Choose PNASoneF for one column; PNAStwoF for two column:
%\usepackage{PNASoneF}
%\usepackage{PNAStwoF}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL STYLE FILES

%% The AMS math files are commonly used to gain access to useful features
%% like extended math fonts and math commands.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL MACRO FILES
%% Insert self-defined macros here.
%% \newcommand definitions are recommended; \def definitions are supported

%\newcommand{\mfrac}[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}}
%\def\s{\sigma}
