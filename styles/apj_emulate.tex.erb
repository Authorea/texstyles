%% If you wish, you may supply running head information, although

%% Mark off your abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. In the manuscript
%% style, abstract will output a Received/Accepted line after the
%% title and affiliation information. No date will appear since the author
%% does not have this information. The dates will be filled in by the
%% editorial office after submission.

<%= @abstract_begin_end %>

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. The uncommented
%% example has been keyed in ApJ style. See the instructions to authors
%% for the journal to which you are submitting your paper to determine
%% what keyword punctuation is appropriate.

%% Authors who wish to have the most important objects in their paper
%% linked in the electronic edition to a data center may do so in the
%% subject header.  Objects should be in the appropriate "individual"
%% headers (e.g. quasars: individual, stars: individual, etc.) with the
%% additional provision that the total number of headers, including each
%% individual object, not exceed six.  The \objectname{} macro, and its
%% alias \object{}, is used to mark each object.  The macro takes the object
%% name as its primary argument.  This name will appear in the paper
%% and serve as the link's anchor in the electronic edition if the name
%% is recognized by the data centers.  The macro also takes an optional
%% argument in parentheses in cases where the data center identification
%% differs from what is to be printed in the paper.

%\object{NGC 6624}, \objectname[M 15]{NGC 7078},

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% In the first two sections, notice the use of the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below. We have
%% chosen the first three characters of the first author's name plus
%% the last two numeral of the year of publication as our KEY for
%% each reference.
