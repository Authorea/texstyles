%  article.tex (Version 1.00, released 1 October 2013)
%  LaTeX source file to demonstrate formatting for manuscripts
%  to be submitted to SPIE journals
%  based on the class file spieman.cls, which requires
%  the following standard packages:  times.sty, float.sty,
%  ifthen.sty, cite.sty, color.sty, setspace.sty
%
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the
%  symbol %>>>>
%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, for example, to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class
%  file (spieman.cls) and may not be understood in other classes:
%  \affiliations{}, \sup{},\supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \keywords{},
%  \linkable and \video
%  The bibliography style file is called spiejour.bst
%  This article.tex file needs the following image files:
%  mcr3b.eps
%  fig2.eps
%  satellite.eps

\documentclass[12pt]{spieman}  %>>> 12pt font mandatory; use this for US letter paper
%%\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{spieman}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress,12pt]{spieman}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  for example, [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX installations.
%%\usepackage{amsmath}  %>>> for AMS math formatting,
%  including bold Greek symbols
\usepackage[]{graphicx}
\usepackage{setspace}
%\usepackage{tocloft}

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the
%  author list and their affiliations.  Use \\ to force linebreaks.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript,
%  which is easily obtained with \supscr{}.
%>>>> After the abstract, the author must include
%  a list of keywords and contact information for the corresponding author.
