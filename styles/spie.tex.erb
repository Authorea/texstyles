%  article.tex (Version 3.3, released 19 January 2008)
%  Article to demonstrate format for SPIE Proceedings
%  Special instructions are included in this file after the
%  symbol %>>>>
%  Numerous commands are commented out, but included to show how
%  to effect various options, e.g., to print page numbers, etc.
%  This LaTeX source file is composed for LaTeX2e.

%  The following commands have been added in the SPIE class
%  file (spie.cls) and will not be understood in other classes:
%  \supit{}, \authorinfo{}, \skiplinehalf, \keywords{}
%  The bibliography style file is called spiebib.bst,
%  which replaces the standard style unstr.bst.

\documentclass[]{spie}  %>>> use for US letter paper
%%\documentclass[a4paper]{spie}  %>>> use this instead for A4 paper
%%\documentclass[nocompress]{spie}  %>>> to avoid compression of citations
%% \addtolength{\voffset}{9mm}   %>>> moves text field down
%% \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.65}   %>>> 1.65 for double spacing, 1.25 for 1.5 spacing
%  The following command loads a graphics package to include images
%  in the document. It may be necessary to specify a DVI driver option,
%  e.g., [dvips], but that may be inappropriate for some LaTeX
%  installations.
\usepackage[]{graphicx}

\title{<%=@title%>}

%>>>> The author is responsible for formatting the
%  author list and their affiliations.  Use \\ to force linebreaks.
%  The correspondence between each author and his/her address
%  can be indicated with a superscript,
%  which is easily obtained with \supscr{}.
%>>>> After the abstract, the author must include
%  a list of keywords and contact information for the corresponding author.

%>>>> Further information about the authors, other than their
%  institution and addresses, should be included as a footnote,
%  which is facilitated by the \authorinfo{} command.

\authorinfo{}
